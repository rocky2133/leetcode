### binary search
pay attention to the boundary
1. the condition of while
2. the change of left and right (left = mid+1, left = mid, right = mid-1, right = mid)
3. mid = (left+right)/2 may greater than INT_MAX, while left+(right-left)/2 won't

### 2 principles of binary search:
1. each time the search range decrease, (E.G. search range [a,a+1], mid = a, nums[a] < target, left = a, the next search range is still [a, a+1], in this case, search range doesn't decrease.)
2. make sure that the change of left and right won't rule out the correct answer.(E.G. in this problem 69. Sqrt(x): we know that mid*mid < target, we can't let left = mid+1, since mid may be the final answer.)
