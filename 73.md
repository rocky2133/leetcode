### space complexity is O(1)

intuitively, we need a array for both x, y to store whether this row or column will be set to zero, and the size is m+n

since there will be some rows and columns which will be set to zero, so we can just store the data we want in these space.

find the first element in matrix which is zero, use its row and column for storing. 
Pay attention: when you set the columns of matrix to zeros based on the value of the row you store data, do not set the column you store data, since you will need it to set rows of matrix next.
