### Monotonic stack (A monotonically increasing or decreasing stack)

keep the item pushed into the stack restrictly greater than the top of the stack(if stack is not empty) => to get the left and the right index of the data which is less than current data. i.e. the range where current is the smallest data.

the sum of subarray that considered data[i] is the minimum depends on the value of data[i] and 
data[i]'s valid range mentioned before.

the # of subarray that considered data[i] is the minimum is the # of subarray in the valid range of data[i], which is equal to the # of subarry whose right boundary is data[i] * the # of subarry whose left boundary is data[i]. i.e.  # = left*right. and sum = data[i]*#.
