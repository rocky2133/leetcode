### heap
time complexity O(nlogk) mantain heap (logk), traverse n elements (n)
space complexity O(k) for heap
c++ priority_queue implement heap
form: priority<Type, vector<Type>, greater/less<Type> > Var;(default is less)
greater: increasing order, other data in the heap is greater than the top, i.e. the top of heap is the smallest data.
less: decreasing order, other data in the heap is less than the top, i.e. the top of heap is the biggest data.


### quickselect
time comlexity O(n): quick sort is O(nlogn), but we don't need to recurse both side of it, since we know where K is. So, the complexity of quickselect is O(n).
space complexity O(1).
