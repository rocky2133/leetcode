### greedy algorithm
sort intervals using custom sort function(by the increasing order of the end of intervals)
traverse intervals, each time choose the most small end intervals[i]: 
if its begin is greater than current end, keep it as a non-overlapping elements
(num++, current end = intervals[i].end)
else check the next interval.
