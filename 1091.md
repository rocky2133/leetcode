### BFS
use queue to store the points.(E.G  first push point A, length = 1, then push the points connected to A, like B,C,D, and pop() to remove A, length = 2.)
each time before explore the Kth floor, pop all the K-1 floor elements in the queue.

use 2d arrary to store the flag whether the point has been visited.
