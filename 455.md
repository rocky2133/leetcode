### greedy algorithm
g[] children, s[] cookies.
sort(g); sort(s); (increasing order)
for each child, check whether the smallest cookie can content him
if content, check the next child and the next cookie.
if not, check whether the next cookie can content the same child.

it can be proved that the best strategy is to satisfy as many ungreedy children as possible.
