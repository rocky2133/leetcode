# RES:
**binary search**
**3 cases for front part iterate:**
	1) left <= target <= mid	(no rotation)
	2,3) left > mid && (target >= left || target <= mid)	(in these 2 cases rotation exist in the front part between left and mid, the elements between left and mid must greater than left or less than mid)
**in other cases, iterate the other part**
---
# tips:
**iterate the latter part left = mid + 1**
**pay attention to the null vector**
---
# first method when read the problem:
do twice binary search:
one time for searching the rotation index,
the other time for searching the target index.
the complexity is also O(log n) but it can be optimized.
