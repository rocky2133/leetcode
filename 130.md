### DFS
first, check the boundary 'O' region, set the flag of boundary 'O' and the 'O's connected to them to 0.(don't check them but don't change their board value)
then, check the inside 'O' region, this time, change their board value.

if the board's width or height is less than 2, then don't need to change anything, since the whole vector of board are boundary.
